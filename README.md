Introdution for the simon game by ChatGPT:  
The Simon game is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison and first manufactured by Milton Bradley in 1978. The game consists of a circular device with four colored buttons that light up and produce sounds in a random sequence. The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. Each round, the sequence becomes longer and more complex, challenging the player's memory and hand-eye coordination.
